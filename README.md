# Bootstrap v4 UI Kit *for* Sketch
A Sketch toolkit with the basic Bootstrap v4 components — created to be ~~customizable~~, resizable &amp; used as a Craft Library.

**Haven't figured out a way to sync colours across various different symbols easily if using Craft (like when using shared styles), so this isn't as customisable as we'd like it to be.*
